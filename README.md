# Python projects - beginner to advanged

This repo contains the learning projects I have created with Python. My goal is to develop my Python skills from beginner to advanced level while being able to look back at what I have done during this process and to inspire newcomers.

I recommend running this on Python 3.8 or higher.

This repo is a learning-focused project. 
Please submit a Pull Request for bug fixes, new examples, or improvements.
